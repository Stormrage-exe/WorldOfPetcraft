                        <h3 id="abouttext">Hey there! I’m a beginner web developer, and this is my first serious project. I’m learning as I go, improving my skills while building something useful for fellow players. Web development has always interested me, and I figured what better way to learn than by creating a site for something I love?</h3>
                        <br>
                        <h1 id="abouttext">Why Did I Make This Site?</h1>
                        <h3 id="abouttext">I’ve always found the Hunter class incredibly fun. One of the best parts of playing a Hunter is finding the perfect pet, whether for looks, abilities, or just personal preference. But searching for pets across multiple sites can be frustrating, especially when you’re trying to make sure a pet is available in the expansion you're playing.</h3>
                        <h3 id="abouttext">That’s why I created World of Petcraft—to make finding Hunter pets simple, efficient, and enjoyable. This site is designed to help you browse pets by expansion, so you’ll always know exactly which ones are available in your version of the game. No more jumping between different sources or wondering if a pet still exists—you’ll find all the details right here.</h3>
                        <br>
                        <h1 id="abouttext">How the Site Works</h1>
                        <h3 id="abouttext">Find Pets by Type – Looking for a specific kind of pet? Browse by categories like wolves, cats, birds, and more.
                            Find Pets by Expansion – If you’re playing on a specific expansion, you can quickly filter pets to make sure they’re available.
                            Detailed Pet Info – Each pet has information about its appearance, abilities, locations, and any unique traits it might have.</h3>

                            <h1 id="abouttext">Learning and Improving</h1>
                            <h3 id="abouttext">Since I’m still learning web development, you might notice things changing over time as I tweak and refine the site. This project is a huge learning experience for me, and I appreciate everyone who visits and uses it.</h3>
                            <h3 id="abouttext">This site is constantly being updated, and new pets will be added as soon as possible. I’m always working to improve things, so if something is missing, don’t worry—it’ll be here soon!</h3>
